# .owl

This directory contains tooling generated by LLM agents using the owl framework.

## What is owl?

owl is a convention for AI-generated meta-tooling:
- Agents draw diagrams, write scripts, generate tests for their own code
- Artifacts live in `.owl/` to avoid polluting the main workspace
- Humans review owl outputs, merge what's useful, discard what's not

## Contents

Nothing yet. When an agent needs to generate tooling for this repo, it will appear here.
